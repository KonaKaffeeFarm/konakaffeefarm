excerpt: 100% pure Hawaiian coffee
---

Aloha! We planted our 400 trees several years ago, and now they are producing high quality beans.  
Organically grown, hand picked, sun dried and processed by us here in the Kona coffee belt on the Big Island of Hawaii, roasted to a medium plus.  
Experience the taste that only pure estate and organically grown 100% Kona can provide!

From our farm to your cup - Aloha!
