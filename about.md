Aloha from Opihihale, south of Captain Cook, on the Big Island of Hawaii. We are a former business owner and teacher from Pittsburgh, PA, now proud coffee farmers. We planted our 400 trees at 1200', and are farming organically in the glorious Kona Coffee Belt. Our Kona Typica trees are pruned, fertilized, and nurtured to grow and provide the unique, fruity taste that Kona coffee is know for worldwide. We hand pick, sun dry, and sell only our beansâ€”thus we are labeled "Estate Coffee". We are members of the Kona Coffee Farmers Association, and we are constantly learning and improving our farming methods and processing practices. Our goal is to grow the best coffee we can! We are excited to reach new customers with green and roasted beans and promise you will enjoy our farm's bounty.
